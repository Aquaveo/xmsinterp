#Summary

Many environmental applications require visualization of point data
measurements. Often point data is interpolated onto a grid or an unstructured
grid for visualization.

''xmsinterp'' is a c++ library that facilitates the interpolation from point
data to other spatial locations (like the locations on a grid). Then the grid
can be used for visualization or inputs to an environmental model.

A python package of the library is also available at anaconda:
https://anaconda.org/Aquaveo/xmsinterp

''xmsinterp'' is used in commercial applications
(https://aquaveo.com - GMS, SMS, WMS) as well as by researchers.
